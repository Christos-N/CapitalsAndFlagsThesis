<h1>Capitals & Flags: An educational application for Geography</h1>

The Android application "Capitals & Flags" was developed in the
Android Studio programming environment using the Java programming language, the XML
markup language and Firebase technologies. The application has a simple and user-friendly
interface, so that people of all ages can use it. First it separates the countries based on the
continent they belong to, displays information about each country and shows the
corresponding flag. Then the user is asked to have memorized them because they will be
evaluated on completing quizzes based on either the capitals or the flags. Also, they may
struggle in certain countries and for this reason they have the ability to save those countries
and then take quizzes only on them. Finally, they can see where they are in relation to other
players in the overall ranking, as well as their individual statistics in each continent and quiz
category. In this way their gradual improvement in geography will be achieved.
